        Welcome to the official readme for the ALIEN INVASION project!
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was created by Oren Carmel as an Avantis job appliance home assignment.
    </p>
    <p><b>
            Run Instructions:
        </b></p>
    <p>
        Start the server: npm start
    </p>
    <p>
        Build the project:
        frontend dist; ng serve
        followed by npm build.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Front End</h3>
    <p>
        Front end contained within the alien-invasion-fe (frontend) folder. Traditional Angular folder structure;
    </p>
    <p>
        src/app/guards for routing guards (functions that will trigger on specified routing events)
    </p>
    <p>
        src/app/pages for page specific components
    </p>
    <p>
        src/app/layout for general layout wrappers.
    </p>
    <p>
        src/app/services; classes acting as state managers, transfering data, handling logic and API requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        src/app/app.component; project root.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Back End</h3>
    <p>
        /bootstrap; all files first loaded on server start. contains integral dependencies such as express, database connection, API configuration etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        /controllers: API application logic. contains routes and business methods, mostly fetching & creating data.
    </p>
    <p>
        /db: Data access layer. partially redundant when using Mongo but a good habit in my honest opinion. 
    </p>
    <p>
        /models: Data models & schemas describing the structure of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        /scripts: Single use scripts for specified use-cases such as clearing & populating tables.
    </p>
    <h3>API</h3>
    <p><b>Routes:</b></p>
    <p>
        /api/aliens: POST -- create an alien
    </p>
    <p>
        /api/aliens: GET - get all aliens - returns a hashmap of arrays, with the keys being alien type.
    </p>
    <p>
        /api/aliens/:param?param=[param] - Get aliens by a param specified in query (defaults to ID).
        Accepts: type, parent, id.
    </p>

    <h3>Known issues:</h3>
    <p>
        Due to time limitations, some elements had to be 'skimmed':
    </p>
    <p>
        Google authentication is limited to until page refresh. User will have to re-authenticate on refresh. <br>
        Unfortunately, did not have enough time to implement token validation expiration, refresh, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Authentication is not currently validated on server side. With firebase being our authentication platform,
        we would have to install a Firebase admin API for auth validation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lack of input validation. Given more time, to scale this app further we would need to validate fields before inserting them to the database.
        <br> That could be achieved using Joi, another library or implementing custom field validation.
    </p>
